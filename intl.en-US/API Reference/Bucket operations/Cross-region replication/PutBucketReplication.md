PutBucketReplication 
=========================================

You can call this operation to configure cross-region replication (CRR) rules for a bucket.

Usage notes 
--------------------------------

Cross-region replication enables the automatic and asynchronous (near real-time) replication of objects across buckets in different OSS regions. Operations such as the creation, overwriting, and deletion of objects can be synchronized from a source bucket to a destination bucket. When you use CRR, take note of the following items:

* CRR is an asynchronous process. Based on the size of the data, it takes several minutes to several hours to replicate data from the source bucket to the destination bucket.

  

* The names of the source bucket and destination bucket must be different. The source bucket and destination bucket must be in different regions.

  For more information, see [Cross-region replication](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Disaster recovery/Cross-region replication.md).

Valid values: * internal: the default link.   * oss_acc: the link in which data transmission is accelerated. **Note** If you set TransferType to oss_acc when you create a CRR rule, OSS checks whether transfer acceleration is enabled for the destination bucket after the CRR rule is created. If transfer acceleration is not enabled for the destination bucket, OSS automatically enables transfer acceleration for the destination bucket.

| InvalidTargetBucket                      | 400 BadRequest   | * The error message returned because the name of the source bucket is the same as that of the destination bucket.   * The error message returned because the specified bucket does not exist.   * The error message returned because the source bucket and destination bucket are owned by different users.    |
| InvalidTargetLocation                    | 400 BadRequest   | The error message returned because the region of the destination bucket is different from the region specified in the XML body of the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In addition, CRR can be configured bidirectional between two buckets. To synchronize data from a source bucket for which a CRR rule is configured to a new destination bucket that is not specified in the CRR rule, you must delete the existing CRR rule first.                      |
| BucketReplicationAlreadyExist            | 400 BadRequest   | The error message returned because CRR has been configured between the requested bucket and another bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
