# PutBucketVersioning

You can call this operation to configure the versioning state of a bucket.

## Usage notes

Note the following items when you call the PutBucketVersioning operation:

-   Only the bucket owner or RAM users that have the PutBucketVersioning permission can configure versioning for a bucket.
-   A bucket can be in one of the following versioning state: disabled, enabled, and suspended. By default, versioning is disabled for a bucket.
-   If versioning is enabled for a bucket, an object that is added to the bucket have a unique version ID. In this case, multiple versions of an object can be stored in OSS at the same time.
-   If versioning is suspended for a bucket, the version ID of an object that is added to the bucket is null. OSS does not store new previous versions for objects that is deleted or overwritten.

For more information about versioning, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Versioning/Overview.md).
