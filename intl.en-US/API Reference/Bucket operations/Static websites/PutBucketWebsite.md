# PutBucketWebsite

You can call this operation to set a bucket to the static website hosting mode and configure redirection rules.

## Usage notes

Static websites are websites where all web pages consist of only static content, including scripts such as JavaScript code running on the client. A bucket that is set to the static website hosting mode does not support content that needs to be processed by the server, such as PHP, JSP, and ASP.NET content.

-   Supported features

    The PutBucketWebsite operation is used to configure the default home page, default 404 page, and RoutingRule of the bucket that is set to the static website hosting mode. RoutingRule is used to specify redirection-based back-to-origin rules and mirroring-based back-to-origin rules. Mirroring-based back-to-origin supports Alibaba Cloud public cloud and Finance Cloud.

-   Access through custom domain names

    To use a custom domain name to access bucket-based static websites, you can use CNAME. For more information, see [Bind custom domain names](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Buckets/Bind custom domain names.md).

-   Index page and error page

    When you set a bucket to the static website hosting mode, you can specify the index page and the error page of the static website. The specified index page and error page must be objects in the bucket.

-   Anonymous access to the root domain name

    After a bucket is set to the static website hosting mode, OSS returns the index page for an anonymous access to the root domain name of the static website, For a signed access to the root domain name of the static website, OSS returns the result of the GetBucket \(ListObjects\) operation.

|The container for the default homepage. Parent node: WebsiteConfiguration |
    |Suffix|String|ConditionalThis parameter must be specified if IndexDocument is specified.

|The default homepage. If this parameter is set, the default homepage is returned for access to objects whose names end with a forward slash \(/\).

Parent node: IndexDocument |
    |SupportSubDir|String|No|Specifies whether a request sent to access a subfolder is redirected to the default homepage of the subfolder. Valid values:

    -   A value of true indicates that the request is redirected to the default homepage of the subfolder.
    -   A value of false indicates that the request is redirected to the default homepage of the root folder instead of that of the subfolder.
If the default homepage for access to bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/subdir/ is set to index.html. A value of false indicates that the request is redirected to bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/index.html, and a value of true indicates that the request is redirected to bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/subdir/index.html.

Default value: false

Parent node: IndexDocument |
    |Type|Enumeration|No|Specifies the operation to perform when the default homepage is set, the name of the accessed object does not end with a forward slash \(/\), and the object does not exist. **Note:** This parameter takes effect only when SupportSubDir is set to true. It takes effect after RoutingRule and before ErrorFile.

If the default homepage for access to bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/abc is set to index.html and the abc object does not exist. The operations corresponding to the valid values of Type are as follows:

    -   0: OSS checks whether the object named abc/index.html, which is in the `object + slash (/) + homepage` format, exists. If the object exists, OSS returns 302 and the Location header `/abc/`, which is in the `forward slash (/) + object + forward slash (/)` format, in the response is URL-encoded. If the object does not exist, OSS returns 404 and continues to check ErrorFile.
    -   1: OSS returns 404 and NoSuchKey and continues to check ErrorFile.
    -   2: OSS checks whether abc/index.html exists. If it exists, the content of the object is returned. If it does not exist, OSS returns 404 and continues to check ErrorFile.
Default value: 0
