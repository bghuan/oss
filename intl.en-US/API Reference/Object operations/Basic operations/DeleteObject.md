# DeleteObject

You can call this operation to delete an object.

## Usage notes

When you call the DeleteObject operation, take note of the following items:

-   You must have write permissions on the object to be deleted.
-   HTTP status code 204 is returned when the DeleteObject operation succeeds, regardless of whether the object exists.
-   If the object you want to delete is a symbolic link, the DeleteObject operation deletes only the symbolic link but not the content that the link directs to.

## Versioning

When you call DeleteObject to delete an object from a versioned bucket, you must determine whether to specify a version ID in the request.

-   Do not specify a version ID \(temporary deletion\)

    By default, if you do not specify a version ID in a DeleteObject request, OSS does not delete the current version of the object but add a delete marker to the object as the new current version. If you perform the GetObject operation on the object, OSS identifies that the current version of the object is a delete marker, and then returns `404 Not Found`. Additionally, the `x-oss-delete-marker` header and the `x-oss-version-id` header that indicates the version ID of the created delete marker are included in the response to the DeleteObject request.

    The value of the `x-oss-delete-marker` header in the response is true, which indicates that the `x-oss-version-id` is the version ID of a delete marker.

-   Specify a version ID \(permanently deletion\)

    If you specify a version ID in a DeleteObject request, OSS permanently deletes the version whose ID is specified by the `versionId` field in the `params` parameter. To delete a version whose ID is null, add `params['versionId'] = "null"` in `params` in the request. OSS identifies the string "null" as the ID of the version to delete, and deletes the version whose ID is null.


## Response headers

|Header|Type|Description|
|:-----|:---|:----------|
|x-oss-delete-marker|bool|-   If you do not specify a version ID when you perform the DeleteObject operation, OSS creates a delete marker as the current version and includes this header with the "true" value in the response.
-   If you specify a version ID to permanently delete a version of the object and the specified version is a delete marker, OSS includes this header with the "true" value in the response.

Valid value: true|
|x-oss-version-id|String|-   If you do not specify a version ID when you perform the DeleteObject operation, OSS creates a delete marker as the current version and includes this header in the response to indicate the version ID of the created delete marker.
-   If you specify an object version ID to permanently delete a version of the object, OSS includes this header in the response to indicate the ID of the deleted version. |
