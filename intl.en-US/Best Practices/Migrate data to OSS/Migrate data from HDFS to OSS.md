# Migrate data from HDFS to OSS

This topic describes how to use the Jindo DistCp tool provided by Alibaba Cloud to migrate data from HDFS to OSS.

Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\) is generally used as the underlying storage for a large amount of data in traditional big data architectures. The DistCp tool provided by Hadoop is usually used to migrate and copy data in HDFS. However, this tool cannot take advantage of the features of OSS, resulting in low efficiency and poor data consistency. In addition, DistCp provides only simple functions, which cannot meet the requirements of users.

Jindo DistCp is a tool provided by Alibaba Cloud to copy files in HDFS. It allows you to copy files within or between large-scale clusters. Jindo DistCp uses MapReduce to distribute files, handle errors, and recover data. It uses lists of files and directories as the input of map/reduce tasks. Each map/reduce task copies the files and directories in the input list. Jindo DistCp supports copying data between HDFS systems, between HDFS and OSS, and between OSS buckets. It also provides various parameters and policies for data copying.

Compared with Hadoop DistCp, Jindo DistCp provides the following benefits when you migrate data from HDFS to OSS:

-   Provides high efficiency. The data migration speed of Jindo DistCp is 1.59 times faster than that of Hadoop DistCp.
-   Provides rich basic functions, multiple copy methods, and various scenario-based optimization policies.
-   Takes advantages of OSS features to perform various operations on files, including compressing files and converting the storage class of the files to IA or Archive.
-   Copies files without change files names to ensure data consistency.
-   Supports various scenarios and can be used to replace Hadoop DistCp. Jindo DistCp supports Hadoop 2.7.x and Hadoop 3.x.

## Prerequisites

-   If you use a user-created ECS cluster, you must deploy a Hadoop 2.7.x or Hadoop 3.x environment and are able to run MapReduce jobs.
-   If you use Alibaba Cloud E-MapReduce:
    -   For EMR-3.28.0 or Bigfoot 2.7.0 and later, you can run Shell commands to use Jindo DistCp. For more information, see [t1903713.dita\#task\_2526637](/intl.en-US/SmartData/Use SmartData in EMR V3.28.X/Use Jindo DistCp.md).
    -   For versions earlier than EMR-3.28.0, compatibility issues may occur when you use Jindo DistCp. You can open a ticket to solve the issues.

## Step 1: Download the JAR package of Jindo DistCp

-   [JAR package of Jindo DistCp for Hadoop 2.7.x](https://smartdata-binary.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/Jindo-distcp/Hadoop2.7%2BS3/jindo-distcp-2.7.3.jar)
-   [JAR package of Jindo DistCp for Hadoop 3.x](https://smartdata-binary.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/Jindo-distcp/Hadoop3.x%2BS3/jindo-distcp-2.7.3.jar)

## Step 2: Configure the AccessKey pair used to access OSS

You can configure the AccessKey pair in either of the following methods:

-   Set the --key, --secret, and --endPoint parameters in the command to configure the AccessKey pair. The following command provides an example on how to configure the AccessKey pair:

    ```
    hadoop jar jindo-distcp-2.7.3.jar --src /data/incoming/example_file --dest oss://example_folder/example_file --key yourAccessKeyId --secret yourAccessKeySecret --endPoint oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com
    ```

    -   --src: specifies the path of the source file, which is `/data/incoming/example_file` in the sample command.
    -   --dest: specifies the path of the destination file, which is `oss://example_folder/example_file` in the sample command.
    -   --key: specifies your AccessKey ID. For more information about AccessKey ID, see [Create an AccessKey pair]().
    -   --secret: specifies your AccessKey Secret. For more information about AccessKey Secret, see [Create an AccessKey pair]().
    -   --endPoint: specifies the endpoint of the region where the bucket that stores the destination file is located, which is `oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com` in the sample command. For more information about the regions and endpoints of OSS, see [Regions and endpoints](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Endpoint/Regions and endpoints.md).
-   Set the --key, --secret, and --endPoint parameters in the core-site.xml configuration file to avoid setting these parameters each time when you copy files to OSS. The following code provides an example on how to set parameters related to AccessKey pairs in the configuration file:

    ```
    <configuration>
        <property>
            <name>fs.jfs.cache.oss-accessKeyId</name>
            <value>xxx</value>
        </property>
        <property>
            <name>fs.jfs.cache.oss-accessKeySecret</name>
            <value>xxx</value>
        </property>
        <property>
            <name>fs.jfs.cache.oss-endpoint</name>
            <value>oss-cn-xxx.aliyuncs.com</value>
        </property>
    </configuration>
    ```

-   Configure the password-free feature of Jindo DistCp to avoid storing your AccessKey pairs in plaintext, which improves data security. For more information, see [t1872858.dita\#task\_2435437](/intl.en-US/SmartData/Use SmartData in EMR versions earlier than V3.27.0/Use the password-free feature of JindoFS SDK.md).

## Step 3: Configure parameters

You can configure multiple parameters to use the various functions provided by Jindo DistCp. The following table describes the parameters that you can configure and configuration examples.
