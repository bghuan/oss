# Service status after overdue payments

If your account balance is insufficient and you continue to use OSS paid services, you will have an overdue payment.

**Warning:** You will be notified if your services are at risk of being suspended due to an overdue payment. To ensure service continuity, settle your overdue payments within the time limit.

An overdue payment leads to the following changes of the OSS service status based on your actions:

-   Your OSS will not be suspended if you top up your balance within360 hours.
-   Your OSS is suspended if you fail to settle all overdue payments within360 hours. However, you will still be charged for the buckets that are being used. Consequently, the overdue amount will continue to increase. Your OSS is activated if you top up your balance to settle all overdue payments withinseven days after OSS is suspended.
-   If you fail to settle all overdue payments withinseven days after OSS is suspended, you will be regarded as voluntarily discarding the use of OSS. Alibaba Cloud will terminate the service terms of OSS and no longer provide you with services related to OSS. Data in your buckets will be deleted and cannot be recovered. Note that you will still be charged for data stored in OSS before the data is deleted. Therefore, if you no longer use OSS, ensure that all your data stored in OSS is deleted.
