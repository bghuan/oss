# Configure static website hosting

You can configure static website hosting for a bucket by using the OSS console and access static websites by using the custom domain name bound to the bucket.

## Usage notes

For security reasons, starting from August 13, 2018 for China regions, and September 25, 2019 for regions outside China, when you access OSS web page objects whose MIME type is text or HTML and whose name extension is HTM, HTML, JSP, PLG, HTX, or STM by using browsers:

-   When you use the default custom domain name, `Content-Disposition:'attachment=filename;'` is automatically included in the response header. Web page objects are downloaded as attachments. You cannot preview the object content.
-   If you use the bound custom domain name, `Content-Disposition:'attachment=filename;'` is not included in the response header. You can preview the object content as long as your browser supports previews of web page objects. For more information about how to bind a custom domain name, see [Bind custom domain names](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Buckets/Bind custom domain names.md).

    |Parameter|Description|

    **Note:** You must ensure that both the index and error documents are readable. Otherwise, static pages cannot be accessed.
