# Overview of the OSS console

The OSS console is a web-based graphical user interface \(GUI\) platform used to manage OSS. The GUI provides an easy and convenient method to manage your OSS resources. This topic provides an overview of the OSS console.

## Overview page

The Overview page displays an overview of all your OSS buckets.

-   **Basic Statistics**

    In the **Basic Statistics** section, you can view the statistical values for **Storage Usage**, **Traffic This Month**, and **Requests This Month** of all buckets in your account.

    **Note:** The data on this page is not updated in real time. There is a latency of one to two hours. These statistics are for reference only.

    -   **Storage Usage**: displays the storage usage of all buckets in your account.
        -   **Total \(Excluding ECS Snapshots\)**: displays the storage usage of all storage classes of buckets, excluding ECS snapshots.
        -   **Standard \(Locally Redundant Storage\)**: displays the storage usage of Standard locally redundant storage \(LRS\) objects. For more information about storage classes, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Storage classes/Overview.md).
        -   **Standard \(Zone-redundant Storage\)**: displays the storage usage of Standard zone-redundant storage \(ZRS\) objects. If ZRS is enabled for a bucket, the redundancy type of objects in the bucket is ZRS. For more information, see [Zone-redundant storage](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Disaster recovery/Zone-redundant storage.md).
        -   **IA \(Locally Redundant Storage\)**: displays the storage usage of IA LRS objects. The storage usage is displayed based on **Actual Storage Usage** and **Billed Storage Usage**.
            -   **Actual Storage Usage**: displays the actual storage usage of IA objects.
            -   **Billed Storage Usage**: displays the billed storage usage of IA objects. The minimum billable size for IA objects is 64 KB. Objects smaller than 64 KB are charged as 64 KB. Therefore, if a bucket contains a large number of small objects, **billed storage usage** may be greater than **actual storage usage**. For more information, see [t4341.md\#section\_t3z\_lxt\_tdb](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Storage classes/Overview.mdsection_t3z_lxt_tdb).
        -   **IA \(Zone-redundant Storage\)**: displays the storage usage of IA ZRS objects. If ZRS is enabled for a bucket, the redundancy type of objects in the bucket is ZRS. The storage usage is displayed based on **Actual Storage Usage** and **Billed Storage Usage**. The storage usage for IA ZRS is calculated in the same way as that for IA LAS.
        -   **Archive**: displays the storage usage of Archive objects. The storage usage is displayed based on **Actual Storage Usage** and **Billed Storage Usage**. The storage usage for Archive is calculated in the same way as that for IA LAS.
        -   **Cold Archive**: displays the storage usage of Cold Archive objects. The storage usage is displayed based on **Actual Storage Usage** and **Billed Storage Usage**. The storage usage for Cold Archive is calculated in the same way as that for IA LAS.
        -   **ECS Snapshots**: displays the storage usage of ECS snapshots. For more information about the ECS snapshot feature, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Snapshots/Snapshot overview.md).
    -   **Traffic This Month**: displays the total traffic usage in the current month of all buckets in your account.
        -   **Outbound Traffic Over Public Network**: displays the traffic generated when you browse or download OSS data over the Internet.
        -   **Inbound Traffic Over Public Network**: displays the traffic generated when you upload data to OSS over the Internet.
        -   **CDN Back-to-Origin Traffic**: displays the back-to-origin traffic generated when you browse or download OSS data over CDN.
    -   **Requests This Month**: displays the total number of API requests received in the current month by all buckets in your account.
        -   **Read Request**: displays all GET requests. For more information, see the "GET requests" section of the [View resource usage](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/View resource usage.md) topic.
        -   **Write Request**: displays all PUT requests. For more information, see the "PUT requests" section of the [View resource usage](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/View resource usage.md) topic.
-   **Basic Settings**

    In the **Basic Settings** section, you can view the basic configurations of all buckets.

    -   **Versioning**: When versioning is enabled for a bucket, data that is overwritten or deleted is saved as a previous version. Versioning allows you to recover objects in a bucket to any previous version, and protects your data from being accidentally overwritten or deleted. For more information about versioning, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Versioning/Overview.md).
    -   **Transfer Acceleration**: helps you accelerate the access to OSS buckets and is ideal for scenarios such as remote data transmission and uploads and downloads of large objects of gigabytes or terabytes in size. For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer acceleration](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Buckets/Transfer acceleration.md).
    -   **Cross-Region Replication**: You can click **View Details** to view all buckets that have cross-region replication \(CRR\) configured and the existing CRR rules. You can click **Configure** in the Actions column corresponding to a bucket to go to the **Cross-Region Replication** section of the bucket. For more information about how to configure CRR, see [Configure CRR](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Redundancy for fault tolerance/Configure CRR.md).
    -   **Domain Names**: You can click **View Details** to view all buckets that have custom domain names bound. You can click **Configure** in the Actions column corresponding to a bucket to go to the **Domain Names** section of the bucket. For more information about how to bind a custom domain name, see [Bind custom domain names](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Manage a domain/Bind custom domain names.md).
    -   **Event Notification**: You can click **View Details** to view all buckets that have event notification configured and the configured event notification rules. You can click **Configure** in the Actions column corresponding to a bucket to go to the **Event Notification** section of the bucket. For more information about how to configure event notification, see [Configure event notification](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Basic settings/Configure event notification.md).
    -   **Security Token \(Authorization for RAM Users\)**: Click **RAM Console**. On the Quick Security Token Configuration page that appears, click **Start Authorization** to create a RAM user and a role for authorization by using STS. For more information about authorization by using STS, see [Access OSS with a temporary access credential provided by STS](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Access and control/Access OSS with a temporary access credential provided by STS.md).
-   **Data Processing**

    In the **Data Processing** section, you can view the data processing services of OSS. You can use these services to process your objects stored in OSS. You can click **Help** for each of these services to view the details of these features.

    In the Bucket Management section, you can view the number of buckets and perform simple operations on buckets.

    -   **Create Bucket**: creates a bucket. For more information, see [Create buckets](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Create buckets.md).
    -   **View Buckets**: displays the **Buckets** page.
    -   **Export CSV**: exports the bucket list to a local computer. This list includes bucket information such as the bucket name, region, storage class, and creation time.
